The UI for this project should be fairly self explanatory, but for the sake of posterity:

The Start Game button will start a new game or restart the current game when clicked.
The View Cards toggle will allow you to view everyone's cards, so you can ensure the game is running properly.
The 3 Sliders underneath said toggle allows you to change how likely the AI is to Challenge, Counter, or Challenge another Counter. These are % based values.
